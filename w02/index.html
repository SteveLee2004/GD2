<h1>Emma Burke</h1> 

<h3>Interviewed by <a href="https://em7715.github.io/GD2/">Steve Lee</a></h3> 

<p style="color: blue">
<strong>What music do you like to listen to while working?</strong><br />
- Anything without words; instrumental or classical music, and also soundtrack.
Interstellar is the most recent soundtrack I listened to.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Name three designers whose work you find inspiring.</strong><br />
<ul>
    <li>Ordinary Folk</li> 
    <li>Kyle Cooper</li>
</ul>
I find them interesting because I am very interested in motion graphics and title sequence designs. 
</p>


<p>
<strong>Name something (a format, an item) you want to learn how to design but haven't had the chance to try to yet. </strong><br />
- Title sequence and packaging
</p>

<p>
<strong>If you were a font, you'd be (you can't say helvetica or comic sans-- both jokes are played). Explain why?</strong><br />
- Avant Garde Gothic, because it has a personality but not too ornamented.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Name one website that you rely on (try to avoid a platform like google/amazon/pinterest/etc).</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.behance.net/for_you " target="_blank">- Behance</a>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is there a movie which you wish you could remake a title sequence of?</strong><br />
- Coraline. I would make it more subtle and vague in a way it starts out happy but hints that something is really wrong. <br>
Just like the title sequence of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwTop2qs1tE" target="_blank">IT: Welcome to Derry</a>.
